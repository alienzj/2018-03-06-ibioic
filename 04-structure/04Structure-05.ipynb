    "The sequence-structure gap is BIG ([77 million sequences](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/TrEMBLstats) vs [123K structures](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/)), so its quite likely that a specific protein of interest has no experimentally solved 3D structure. For such proteins it may be possible to predict the secondary and tertiary structure from the amino acids sequence. There are many different programs designed for structure prediction. In the 2016 [CASP 12](http://www.predictioncenter.org/casp12/index.cgi) (Critical assessement of protein structure prediction) competition (essentially a bake-off for fold prediction programs), more than 100 different programs were tested, all with varing degress of success.\n",
