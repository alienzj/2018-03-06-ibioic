    "It would be easier to compare the WT and the mutant PML protein structures if we could superimpose them. There are many different programs that can be used to superimpose protein structures to observe differences. It is possible to superimpose protein structures through web-based tools from the RCSB. Here we will use the [FATCAT tool](http://fatcat.sanfordburnham.org/) (accessed via the RCSB database) to superimpose the wild type PML (PDB: 4GW3) and the mutated enzyme Dieselzyme4 (4HS9).\n",
