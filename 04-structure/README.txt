04: Structural Bioinformatics
In this section I will introduce some basic theory about protein structures, structure prediction and protein sequnece/structure/function
realtionships. I will also integrate practical sessions that will introduce the structural information available for the PM lipases.

Section 1: slides: what is protein structure, protein folding, techniques for solving protein structures, the RCSB database.
  Practical 04-01: Searching for data in the RCSB

Section 2: slides: protein structure file format, visualisation
  Practical 04-02: Protein structure visualisation using NGL

Section 3: slides: Sequence/strcture/function relationships, protein families
  Practical 04-03: Protein visualisation in Jmol: functional regions of PM lipases
  Practical 04-04: Structural alignment of WT and mutant PML

Section 04: slides:Protein sequence-structure gap, predicting function from sequence
  Practical 04-05: Predicting secondary structure, Predicting tertiary structure

Section 05: slides: Its not all about structure
Section 06: slides: Summary
