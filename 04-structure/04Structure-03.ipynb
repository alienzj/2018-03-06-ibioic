    "### 04-03 Visualizing PM lipase structures in Jmol using scripting\n",
    "So far we have used the web based viewer NGL to visualise a protein structure. But using such web based browsers is limited as we cannot carry out more complex visualizations such as \n",

    "* selecting specific atoms of interest \n",
    "* superimposing a number of different structures   \n",
    "* animating structures for a presentation or demonstration\n",

    "In this practical we will view and analyse the PM lipase structures using [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net), an open source molecular viewer which allows scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jmol has 3 basic elements: the viewing window, the console and the script editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The viewing window is where the protein is rendered in 3D\n",
    "*  The console is where script commands can be entered at a command-line prompt and these commands then make changes to the structure loaded in the viewing window. \n",
    "*  The script-editor is where a series of Jmol commands can be put together in script and the stript run, to makes a series of changes to the structure in the veiwing window in one go. Depending on what set-up you are using you can usually drag and drop scripts into the console and the script-editor (this should work on the sytem today)(or on some systems you can Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V). See the [Jmol wiki](http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Copying_and_pasting_scripts) for more details\n",
