===================
Installing ``JAVA``
===================

The tools `ARTEMIS`_, `JALVIEW`_, and `JMOL`_ are all Java-based, and require the JVM to
run. Java is usually present on Linux (and Windows?) machines, but is not available on
macOS by default

------------------
macOS installation
------------------

The latest version of Java is available as a ``.dmg`` installer:

- `Java VM installer <https://www.java.com/en/download/>`_

To install, download the file, open it and follow the instructions.

------------------
Linux installation
------------------

Java is likely already installed on your machine. You can test whether it is by issuing
the following command at the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    java -version

This should return a short account of the Java version. If it does not, then please follow
the instructions at the page below:

- `Java Installation for Linux`_

--------------------
Windows installation
--------------------

Java is likely already installed on your machine. If it is not, please follow the instructions
at the page below:

- `Java Installation for Windows`_
